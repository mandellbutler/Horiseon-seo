# HOMEWORK 1: HORISEON SEO Code Refactor

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

*** ACTIONS PERFORMED ***
As requested by the client, I reviewed the provided codebase and made several changes to assure Acceptance Criteria were met. Upon reviewing the source code, you will find that semantic elements were used to improve structure and optimization.

To improve accessibility standards, I added 'alt' attributes to the images provided, assured heading attributes followed a flowing and sequential order, and provided an optimized/descriptive title: Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.

Additionally, you will find the codebase has been improved, resulting in complete functionality of navigational links.

In reference to the CSS stylesheet, there have been several changes made. By making small adjustments to CSS selector names and properties, to follow semantic structure, I successfully consildated several lines of code. Please see CSS comments for further detail.
